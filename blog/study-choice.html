                                <p class="details">I began my IT journey when I was in fifth grade or about 12 years
                                    old.
                                    It happened all of the sudden. I got into my dream high school and met my mentor as
                                    I
                                    stated in the <a href="../index.html">home page</a>. Until that moment I dreamt of
                                    becoming an archeologist, but everything changed in that chance meeting.
                                </p>
                                <p class="details">Then a few months later I was with my father
                                    and he suggested showing me how to make a calculator. So we did a calculator in c++.
                                    It was
                                    my greatest achievement at that moment and I still cherish the memory of it (even
                                    though the
                                    calculator was made with integers and when you divided 5 by 2 the result was 2).
                                </p>
                                <p class="details">
                                    Then I started going to different ICT competitions with my mentor. In the beginning,
                                    I was
                                    doing
                                    little games with PowerPoint (the main reason I know a little bit of VisualBasic)
                                    and then I
                                    switched to coding.
                                    My father helped me learn HTML and CSS by enrolling me in his company's academy when
                                    I was
                                    in seventh grade. After that
                                    my journey continued with C#, SQL, and more and I continued going to the academy
                                    inofficially. I got officially into the academy in the summer of 2021. I learned
                                    there
                                    OOP (in C#), SQL, EntityFramework, and a little bit of Blazor. At the beginning of
                                    2022
                                    I took upon a challenge to learn ASP.NET for a project our school had to make for
                                    regional education management. In the spring of 2022, I graduated high school with
                                    the main
                                    subjects of Math, ICT, and CS.
                                    I graduated also from a national educational program "IT Career" as a third-degree
                                    applied
                                    programmer.
                                </p>
                                <p class="details">
                                    I love everything that has to do with coding but there are a few more memorable
                                    moments.
                                    For example some of my proudest moments were the periods
                                    when I
                                    had been a substitute CS teacher and there I realized that I loved seeing the faces
                                    of my
                                    classmates when
                                    they understood what I had explained. So even though I haven't decided if I want to
                                    become a
                                    developer or a teacher I know that my place in the world is somewhere within the IT
                                    field.

                                    When I was 12 years old, I decided that I wanted to study something with computers
                                    in
                                    the future. After that part of my education, I enrolled in a class with the main
                                    subjects being mathematics, ICT, and computer science It felt only natural to
                                    continue
                                    with this path and I would be completely lost if I hadn't. I wanted to study this
                                    programme because of the paths it gives you, so this way I have the opportunity to
                                    study
                                    software engineering as this was my original plan. But this way, I can get an
                                    introduction to data science, which in the end could be more interesting for me.
                                    Either
                                    way, I am very happy that I can decide which route to take when the time comes.

                                    For the moment being, I don't have an exact idea of what am I going to do after I
                                    graduate. I would probably try to get a job as a junior software developer in some
                                    small
                                    company in the beginning. After that, I would like to try to work in an enterprise,
                                    because I think that this way I can get a feeling of what kind of company I would
                                    like
                                    to work for the most, so this way I can be sure what will be the perfect workplace
                                    for
                                    me. I expect to learn (except for programming skills) how to be a more practical and
                                    better team player, so I can do better in the future
