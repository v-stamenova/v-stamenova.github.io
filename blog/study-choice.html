                                    When I was 12 years old, I decided that I wanted to study something with computers
                                    in
                                    the future. After that part of my education, I enrolled in a class with the main
                                    subjects being mathematics, ICT, and computer science It felt only natural to
                                    continue
                                    with this path and I would be completely lost if I hadn't. I wanted to study this
                                    programme because of the paths it gives you, so this way I have the opportunity to
                                    study
                                    software engineering as this was my original plan. But this way, I can get an
                                    introduction to data science, which in the end could be more interesting for me.
                                    Either
                                    way, I am very happy that I can decide which route to take when the time comes.

                                    For the moment being, I don't have an exact idea of what am I going to do after I
                                    graduate. I would probably try to get a job as a junior software developer in some
                                    small
                                    company in the beginning. After that, I would like to try to work in an enterprise,
                                    because I think that this way I can get a feeling of what kind of company I would
                                    like
                                    to work for the most, so this way I can be sure what will be the perfect workplace
                                    for
                                    me. I expect to learn (except for programming skills) how to be a more practical and
                                    better team player, so I can do better in the future
