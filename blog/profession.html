                                    Searching for your dream position and company is a long and difficult search full of
                                    unexpected things. Here I am listing my top 3 companies that I would like to work as
                                    a part of the software engineering team. These companies are companies that work
                                    with the language C#, and I have chosen this to be my main factor because of my
                                    previous experience with that language (see Profile page). In every of those
                                    companies, I would want to work as a software engineer. The SE designs, code and
                                    debugs software, maintain, upgrade the existing software, train and supervises
                                    interns and others. This way I can combine my passion for coding and teaching.
