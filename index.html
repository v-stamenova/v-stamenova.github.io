                        <p>I discovered the wonderful world of IT when I was still a child. I've spent countless hours
                            playing Little Big Planet, Killzone 3, GTA Vice City, Minecraft, and that is to name a few.
                            But it wasn't until I was 12 years old that I fell in love with it. I had been accepted to
                            my dream highschool in my town and there I met my mentor. She was and still is one of my
                            biggest
                            supporters and inspiration. She made me realize that I can achieve something with just my
                            imagination, thinking, and a computer.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-md-6">
                        <img class="div-pic" src="/images/teaching.jpg">
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="row py-5 med-par">
                    <div class="col">
                        <p>Then a few months later I was with my father
                            and he suggested showing me how to make a calculator. So we did a calculator in c++. It was
                            my greatest achievement at that moment and I still cherish the memory of it (even though the
                            calculator was made with integers and when you divided 5 by 2 the result was 2).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Then I started going to different ICT competitions with my mentor. In the beginning, I was
                            doing
                            little games with PowerPoint (the main reason I know a little bit of VisualBasic) and then I
                            switched to coding.
                            My father helped me learn HTML and CSS by enrolling me in his company's academy when I was
                            in seventh grade. After that
                            my journey continued with C#, SQL, and more and I continued going to the academy
                            inofficially. I got officially into the academy in the summer of 2021. I learned there
                            OOP (in C#), SQL, EntityFramework, and a little bit of Blazor. At the beginning of 2022
                            I took upon a challenge to learn ASP.NET for a project our school had to make for
                            regional education management. In the spring of 2022, I graduated high school with the main
                            subjects of Math, ICT, and CS.
                            I graduated also from a national educational program "IT Career" as a third-degree applied
                            programmer.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I love everything that has to do with coding but there are a few more memorable moments.
                            For example some of my proudest moments were the periods
                            when I
                            had been a substitute CS teacher and there I realized that I loved seeing the faces of my
                            classmates when
                            they understood what I had explained. So even though I haven't decided if I want to become a
                            developer or a teacher I know that my place in the world is somewhere within the IT field.
