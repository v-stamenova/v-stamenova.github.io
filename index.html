                        <p>I discovered the wonderous world of IT
                            when I was still a child. I've spent countless hours
                            playing Little Big Planet, Killzone 3, GTA Vice city, Minecraft and that is to name a few.
                            But it wasn't untill I was 12 years old untill I fell in love with it. I just got into my
                            dream school in my town and I met my mentor. She was and still is one of my biggest
                            supporters and inspiration. She made me realise that I can achive something with just my
                            imagination, thinking and a computer.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-6">
                        <img class="div-pic" src="/images/teaching.jpg">
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="row py-5 med-par">
                    <div class="col">
                        <p>Then a few months later I was with my father
                            and he suggested showing me how to make calculator. So we did a calculator on c++. It was my
                            greatest achivement in that moment and I still cherish the memory of it (even though the
                            calculator was made with integers and when you divided 5 by 2 the result was 2). My mentor
                            and my dad
                            motivated me to learn the basics of Visual Basic, then of HTML and CSS. After that my
                            journey continued with C#, SQL and more. One of my proudest moments was the moments where I
                            had been a substitute CS teacher and I loved seeing the faces of my fellow classmates when
                            they understood what I had explained. So even though I haven't decided if I want to become a
                            developer or a teacher I know that my place in the world is somewhere within the IT field.
